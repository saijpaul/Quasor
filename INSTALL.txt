Instructions to Install the application:
---------------------------------------

This application is not yet published in android market. I still need to perform more rigrious 
testing along with addition of some features before this app is ready to be published in the market.

FOR DEVELOPER USING ECLIPSE IDE:
--------------------------------

1. For complete instruction on system requirements, installing Android SDK and ADT Plugin with IDE,Please look at the below link:

http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html#components

2. For complete instruction on creating Android Virtual Device to launch Emulator,Please look at the below link:

http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html

3. After installing Android SDK, Emulator and ADT Plugin with IDE you can download the source code 
of the application located in a folder called "Quasor" located in "QuasorProjectDownload" folder from the below link:

https://github.com/saijpaul/Quasor

4. Now, create an android project using Select File > Import > existing projects > select Quasor

You would also require to build a local database using the following instructions:

   (a)Open adb and run "adb shell" to get remote shell access
   (b)Create a folder called "databases" under /data/data/com.saijpaul.quasor/
   (c)exit

After you have successfully created a folder named "databases" you need to copy-paste the QuasorDB.db
file from asset folder(present in project source code) under the newly created "databases" folder. 

For transferring QuasorDB.db under "databases" folder,launch your emulator(having same platform as that of your application,
in this application's case it is 2.2).Once emulator is started, go to windows->open perspective->
DDMS->File Explorer window->data->data->databases.

For pushing the databases file under "databases" folder click on "Push a file onto the device" option in top 
right corner of file explorer window.

2.) For user submitted remedies functionality, download the server code located in folder "QuasorServerSideCode" from below location:

https://github.com/saijpaul/Quasor  

To build remote database on server, you would require to install Apache server, MySQL database(Please look Below for the SQL 
creation Scripts*) and PHP 5.1. Services Apache and MySQL must be started for this functionality to work properly.

Inorder to install all of the above and configure your apache server to locate your project server code(php files),
please look at the below link:

http://www.php-mysql-tutorial.com/wikis/php-tutorial/installing-php-and-mysql.aspx


Now you application set up is complete and you can run the application in emulator by right-clicking on the
project folder, click on Run As --> Android application. This should result in application being launched automatically on the emulator.


FOR END USERS WITH ANDROID SDK FOR RUNNING APP ON EMULATOR:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once you are inside that directory, type the following command: 

adb devices (Press enter)

List of devices attached
b343433453335dfdfddf233   device

You should see a line similar to above indicating that the Adb has detected the phone.
